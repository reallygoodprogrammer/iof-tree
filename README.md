# iof-tree

usage: `iof-tree [-c concurrency-level] url [urls]+`

A go script for recursing through an 'Index of' directory page, only
pulling urls from other pages with 'Index of' prefix in title. This 
tool is probably not as intensive as it could be currently; there
are probably versions of these directory pages that don't match the 
same format that I am matching for in this script. I'll likely add
more to it as I need it.
